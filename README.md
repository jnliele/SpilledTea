# SpilledTea
SpilledTea is a GUI application built using the GTKMM library that allows users
to order boba drinks. Users will give their names and be able to choose the type
of drink, topping, and quantity they want for their orders. 

This is a small project using the principles of object-oriented programming in C++.
